Migration guide to Zephyr v3.7.0 (Working Draft)
################################################

This document describes the changes required when migrating your application from Zephyr v3.6.0 to
Zephyr v3.7.0.

Any other changes (not directly related to migrating applications) can be found in
the :ref:`release notes<zephyr_3.7>`.

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
=================================

Bluetooth HCI
=============

Controller Area Network (CAN)
=============================

* Removed the following deprecated CAN controller devicetree properties. Out-of-tree boards using
  these properties need to switch to using the ``bus-speed``, ``sample-point``, ``bus-speed-data``,
  and ``sample-point-data`` devicetree properties for specifying the initial CAN bitrate:

  * ``sjw``
  * ``prop-seg``
  * ``phase-seg1``
  * ``phase-seg1``
  * ``sjw-data``
  * ``prop-seg-data``
  * ``phase-seg1-data``
  * ``phase-seg1-data``

* The zperf zperf_results struct is changed to support 64 bits transferred bytes (total_len)
  and test duration (time_in_us and client_time_in_us), instead of 32 bits. This will make
  the long-duration zperf test show with correct throughput result.
  (:github:`69500`)

* Each IPv4 address assigned to a network interface has an IPv4 netmask
  tied to it instead of being set for the whole interface.
  If there is only one IPv4 address specified for a network interface,
  nothing changes from the user point of view. But, if there is more than
  one IPv4 address / network interface, the netmask must be specified
  for each IPv4 address separately. (:github:`68419`)

* Virtual network interface API no longer has the `input` callback. The input callback was
  used to read the inner IPv4/IPv6 packets in an IP tunnel. This incoming tunnel read is now
  implemented in `recv` callback. (:github:`70549`)

* Modified the ``wifi connect`` command to use key-value format for the arguments. In the
  previous implementation, we were identifying an option using its position in the argument string.
  This made it difficult to deal with optional arguments or extending the support
  for other options. Having this key-value format makes it easier to extend the options that
  can be passed to the connect command.
  ``wifi -h`` will give more information about the usage of connect command.
